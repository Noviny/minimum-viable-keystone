# minimum-viable-keystone

This is a small experiment on what the absolute barest bones implementaiton of a [keystoneJS](keystonejs.com) site. In doing so it aims not to break keystone's recommended folder structure. I'm putting this up in case anyone is just looking for a code shell to start from.

It includes:

- `keystone.js` start script
- most basic user model
- router set up with a single view to render
- update script with initial user
